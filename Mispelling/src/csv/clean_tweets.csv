christians are ready to proclaim the gospel because they cant hide the joy that comes from knowing christ
are you angry with someone  pray for that person  that is what christian love is

we must not be afraid of solidarity rather let us make all we have and are available to god
with the culture of waste human life is no longer considered the primary value to be respected and protected
consumerism has accustomed us to waste  but throwing food away is like stealing it from the poor and hungry
care of creation is not just something god spoke of at the dawn of history he entrusts it to each of us as pa
christ leads us to go out from ourselves more and more to give ourselves and to serve others
sometimes we know what we have to do but we lack the courage to do itlet us learn from mary how to make decisions trusting in the lord
the world tells us to seek success power and moneygod tells us to seek humility service and love
in this year of faith we pray to the lord that the church may always be a true family that brings gods love to everyone
the whole of salvation history is the story of god looking for us he offers us love and welcomes us with tenderness
the church is born from the supreme act of love on the cross from jesus open side  the church is a family where we love and are loved
dear young people the church expects great things of you and your generosity dont be afraid to aim high
every time we give in to selfishness and say no to god we spoil his loving plan for us
we all have in our hea
miracles happen but prayer is needed prayer that is courageous struggling and persevering not prayer that is a mere formality

do not be content to live a mediocre christian life walk with determination along the path of holiness
let us ask our lord to help us bear shining witness to his mercy and his love in every area of our christian lives
every christian is a missionary to the extent that he or she bears witness to gods love  be missionaries of gods tenderness
let us ask our lady to teach us how to live out our faith in our daily lives and to make more room for the lord
it would be a good idea during may for families to say the rosary together  prayer strengthens family life
my thoughts turn to all who are unemployed often as a result of a selfcentred mindset bent on profit at any cost
dear young friends learn from saint joseph he went through difficult times but he always trusted and he knew how to overcome adversity
let us put our trust in gods power at work  with him we can do great things  he will give us the joy of being his disciples
how marvellous it would be if at the end of the day each of us could say today i have performed an act of charity towards others
the holy spirit truly transforms us  with our cooperation he also wants to transform the world we live in

please join me in praying for the victims of the explosion in texas and their families
to enter into the glory of god demands daily fidelity to his will even when it requires sacrifice
jesus ascension into heaven does not mean his absence but that he is alive among us in a new way close to each one of us
worshipping god means learning to be with him stripping away our hidden idols and placing him at the centre of our lives
let us not forget if we are to proclaim the gospel of jesus our lives must bear witness to what we preach
if we act like children of god knowing that he loves us our lives will be made new filled with serenity and joy
being a christian is not just about following commandments it is about letting christ take possession of our lives and transform them
how beautiful is the gaze with which jesus regards us  how full of tenderness  let us never lose trust in the patience and mercy of god
god loves us  we must not be afraid to love him  the faith is professed with the lips and with the hea
accept the risen jesus into your life even if you have been far away take a small step towards him he awaits you with open arms
suppo
to experience holy week is to enter more and more into god's logic of love and selfgiving
being with jesus demands that we go out from ourselves and from living a tired and habitual faith
we must not believe the evil one when he tells us that there is nothing we can do in the face of violence injustice and sin
