we want people to be able to own their own home  but the percentage of people who own their own homes is going down
we are building fewer than half the number of homes we need

david cameron introduced the bedroom tax  in seven days we can scrap it
working people are    worse off under the tories
child benefit is the key part of family budgets in this country    so why won t david cameron rule out cutting it
david cameron he didn   t    want     to cut child tax credit     but he didn   t rule it out
working families can   t afford five more years of the tories and their cuts to child benefit and tax credits
the choice      with labour the recovery will reach working families     with the tories cuts to child benefit and tax credits
on  we   ll see the election choice between labour on the side of working families  or the country going backwards under the tories
on the nhs  on the bedroom tax and on zero hours contracts  david cameron won   t be able to defend his record tonight
