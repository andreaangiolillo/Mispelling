Let us sing as we go. May our struggles and our concern for this planet never take away the joy of our hope.
An integral ecology includes taking time to reflect on our lifestyle and our ideals. #LaudatoSi
Christian spirituality proposes an alternative understanding of the quality of life.
Living our vocation to be protectors of God’s handiwork is not a secondary aspect of our Christian experience.
"The teachings of the Gospel have direct consequences for our way of thinking, feeling and living. #LaudatoSi"
"The emptier a person’s heart is, the more he or she needs to buy, own and consume. #LaudatoSi"
"Many things have to change course, but it is we human beings above all who need to change."
Believers must feel challenged to live in a way consonant with their faith. #LaudatoSi
We know how unsustainable is the behaviour of those who constantly consume and destroy.
A decrease in the pace of production and consumption can at times give rise to another form of progress and development.

"For indigenous communities, land is not a commodity, but a gift from God, a sacred space."
We need an integrated approach to combating poverty and protecting nature.
It is contrary to human dignity to cause animals to suffer or die needlessly. #LaudatoSi
"The culture of relativism drives one person to take advantage of another, to treat others as mere objects."
Christian thought sees human beings as possessing a particular dignity above other creatures.
There is an urgent need for us to move forward in a bold cultural revolution. #LaudatoSi
Scientific and technological progress cannot be equated with the progress of humanity and history.
By itself the market cannot guarantee integral human development and social inclusion.
We are learning all too slowly the lessons of environmental deterioration. #LaudatoSi
It is possible that we don’t grasp the gravity of the challenges before us. #LaudatoSi
Each age tends to have only a meagre awareness of its own limitations.
"Never has humanity had such power over itself, yet nothing ensures that it will be used wisely."
"For believers, this becomes a question of fidelity to the Creator."
"Earth is essentially a shared inheritance, whose fruits are meant to benefit everyone. #LaudatoSi"
We continue to tolerate some considering themselves more worthy than others.

"A fragile world challenges us to devise intelligent ways of directing, developing and limiting our power."
"Every creature is the object of the Father’s tenderness, who gives it its place in the world."
“Creation” has a broader meaning than “nature”; it has to do with God’s loving plan. #LaudatoSi
Each community has the duty to protect the earth and to ensure its fruitfulness for coming generations.
The present world system is certainly unsustainable from a number of points of view. #LaudatoSi
We need only to take a frank look at the facts to see that our common home is falling into serious disrepair. #LaudatoSi
"Whatever is fragile, like the environment, is defenceless before the interests of a deified market."
The alliance between economy and technology ends up sidelining anything unrelated to its immediate interests.
Economic interests easily end up trumping the common good.
There is no room for the globalization of indifference. #LaudatoSi
Developed countries ought to help pay this debt by limiting their consumption of nonrenewable energy.
"A true “ecological debt” exists, particularly between the global north and south."
"To blame population growth, and not an extreme consumerism on the part of some, is one way of refusing to face the issues."
We have to hear both the cry of the earth and the cry of the poor. #LaudatoSi
The deterioration of the environment and of society affect the most vulnerable people on the planet.
The human environment and the natural environment deteriorate together.
One particularly serious problem is the quality of water available to the poor. #LaudatoSi
These problems are closely linked to a throwaway culture.
"The earth, our home, is beginning to look more and more like an immense pile of filth."
Climate change represents one of the principal challenges facing humanity in our day. #LaudatoSi
"The climate is a common good, belonging to all and meant for all."
“To commit a crime against the natural world is a sin against ourselves and a sin against God.” (Patriarch Bartholomew)
The throwaway culture of today calls for a new lifestyle. #LaudatoSi
There is a value proper to each creature.
There is a need to seek other ways of understanding the economy and progress. #LaudatoSi
There is an intimate relationship between the poor and the fragility of the planet. #LaudatoSi
We need a new dialogue about how we are shaping the future of our planet. #LaudatoSi
I invite all to pause to think about the challenges we face regarding care for our common home. #LaudatoSi

"Mary, Mother of Sorrows, help us to understand God’s will in moments of great suffering."
The Lord never tires of forgiving us.  It is we who get tired of asking for pardon.
We can bring the Gospel to others only if it has made a deep impact in our lives.
"Lord, give us the gift of tears, the ability to cry for our sins and so receive your forgiveness."
"Lord, help us to live the virtue of generosity, to love without limits."
Christ is risen!  Christ is alive and journeys with us!
The Cross of Christ is not a defeat: the Cross is love and mercy.
Jesus washes the feet of the Apostles.  Are we ready to serve others like this?
"Confession is the sacrament of the tenderness of God, his way of embracing us."
Holy Week is a privileged time when we are called to draw near to Jesus: friendship with him is shown in times of difficulty.
"As disciples of Christ, how can we not be concerned for the good of the weakest?"
"Life is a precious gift, but we realize this only when we give it to others."
The laity are called to become a leaven of Christian living within society.
Suffering is a call to conversion: it reminds us of our frailty and vulnerability.
May every Church and Christian community be a place of mercy amid so much indifference.
Let us allow God to fill our hearts with his goodness and mercy.
Lent is a time for drawing near to Christ by listening to the word of God and celebrating the sacraments.
"Beware of getting too comfortable!  When we are comfortable, it’s easy to forget other people."
"In the roughest moments, remember: God is our Father; God does not abandon his children."
Humility saves man: pride makes him lose his way.
Let us build our lives of faith on the rock who is Christ.
"If we are too attached to riches, we are not free.  We are slaves."
"The heart grows hard when it does not love.  Lord, give us a heart that knows how to love."
"Jesus intercedes for us each day.  Let us pray: Lord, have mercy on me; intercede for me!"
There is no sin that God cannot pardon.  All we need to do is ask for forgiveness.
The Sacraments are the manifestation of the Father’s tenderness and love towards each of us.
"Wherever there are men and women who have consecrated their lives to God, there you find joy."
"Lord, grant us the grace to know we are sinners."
"During Lent, let us find concrete ways to overcome our indifference."
Jesus came to bring joy to everyone in every age.
Jesus is not a figure from the past: he continues now and always to light the way for us.
"Having faith does not mean having no difficulties, but having the strength to face them, knowing we are not alone."
We are all sinners.  We are all called to a conversion of heart.
A credible witness to truth and to the values of the Gospel is urgently needed.
True love does not pay attention to the evil it suffers.  It rejoices in doing good.
"Auschwitz cries out with the pain of immense suffering and pleads for a future of respect, peace and encounter among peoples."
Practicing charity is the best way to evangelize.

Every marriage has difficult moments.  But these experiences of the Cross can make the path of love even stronger.
We do not become Christians by ourselves. Faith is above all a gift from God which is given to us in and through the Church.
God’s forgiveness is stronger than any sin.
"Let us ask the Lord to give us the gentleness to look upon the poor with understanding and love, devoid of human calculation and fear."
The Church has no other meaning and finality than to witness to Jesus. May we not forget this.
True charity requires courage: let us overcome the fear of getting our hands dirty so as to help those in need.
Christ is always faithful. Let us pray to be always faithful to him.
"We are all sinners, but we experience the joy of God’s forgiveness and we walk forward trusting in his mercy."
There are many people in need in today’s world. Am I self-absorbed in my own concerns or am I aware of those who need help?
Seeking happiness in material things is a sure way of being unhappy.
Sometimes it is possible to live without knowing our neighbours: this is not Christian.

"Let us ask Mary to help us fix our eyes intently on Jesus, to follow him always, even when this is demanding."
Faith is not something decorative or for show. To have faith means to put Christ truly at the centre of our lives.
The love of God is not something vague or generic; the love of God has a name and a face: Jesus Christ.
"Let us allow Jesus into our lives, and leave behind our selfishness, indifference and closed attitudes to others."
"Jesus is the gate opening up to salvation, a gate open to everyone."
Don’t be afraid to ask God for forgiveness.  He never tires of forgiving us.  God is pure mercy.
"Lord, teach us to step outside ourselves. Teach us to go out into the streets and manifest your love."
An excellent program for our lives: the Beatitudes and Matthew Chapter 25.
"We cannot be Christians part-time.  If Christ is at the center of our lives, he is present in all that we do."
We cannot sleep peacefully while babies are dying of hunger and the elderly are without medical assistance.
"Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, and guide us on the way that leads to Heaven."

Today we begin a wonderful week in Rio; may it be a time to deepen our friendship in Jesus Christ.
I am arriving in Brazil in a few hours and my heart is already full of joy because soon I will be with you to celebrate the 28th WYD.
How many wish to be in Rio for WYD but can’t!  May they feel at one with us in prayer.
"Dear young friends, I know that many of you are still travelling to Rio.  May the Lord accompany you on your way."
Many of you have already arrived in Rio and many more are just arriving.  We will see one another there in only three days.
"In this Year of Faith, let us remember that faith is not something we possess, but something we share.  Every Christian is an apostle."
"God is so merciful toward us.  We too should learn to be merciful, especially with those who suffer."
"Prayer, humility, and charity toward all are essential in the Christian life: they are the way to holiness."
"For a Christian, life is not the product of mere chance, but the fruit of a call and personal love."
In this Year of Faith let us aim to do something concrete every day to know Jesus Christ better.
"Lord, grant us the grace to weep over our indifference, over the cruelty that is in the world and in ourselves."
"If we wish to follow Christ closely, we cannot choose an easy, quiet life.  It will be a demanding life, but full of joy."
Christians are always full of hope; they should never get discouraged.
We pray for a heart which will embrace immigrants.  God will judge us upon how we have treated the most needy.
"The Lord speaks to us through the Scriptures and in our prayer.  Let us learn to keep silence before him, as we meditate upon the Gospel."
Jesus is more than a friend.  He is a teacher of truth and life who shows us the way that leads to happiness.
Christ’s love and friendship are no illusion.  On the Cross Jesus showed how real they are.
"We cannot live as Christians separate from the rock who is Christ.  He gives us strength and stability, but also joy and serenity."
"A Christian is never bored or sad.  Rather, the one who loves Christ is full of joy and radiates joy."

Jesus didn’t save us with an idea.  He humbled himself and became a man.  The Word became Flesh.
"Charity, patience and tenderness are very beautiful gifts.  If you have them, you want to share them with others."
"Are we ready to be Christians full-time, showing our commitment by word and deed?"
"We are all sinners.  But may the Lord not let us be hypocrites.  Hypocrites don’t know the meaning of forgiveness, joy and the love of God."
"If we have found in Jesus meaning for our own lives, we cannot be indifferent to those who are suffering and sad."
Let us never forget that it is the Lord who guides the Church.  He is the one who makes our apostolates fruitful.
Christians are ready to proclaim the Gospel because they can’t hide the joy that comes from knowing Christ.
Are you angry with someone?  Pray for that person.  That is what Christian love is.
"Let the Church always be a place of mercy and hope, where everyone is welcomed, loved and forgiven."
How many kinds of moral and material poverty we face today as a result of denying God and putting so many idols in his place!
We must not be afraid of solidarity; rather let us make all we have and are available to God.
"With the “culture of waste”, human life is no longer considered the primary value to be respected and protected."
Consumerism has accustomed us to waste.  But throwing food away is like stealing it from the poor and hungry.
Care of creation is not just something God spoke of at the dawn of history: he entrusts it to each of us as part of his plan.
"Christ leads us to go out from ourselves more and more, to give ourselves and to serve others."
"Sometimes we know what we have to do, but we lack the courage to do it.
Let us learn from Mary how to make decisions, trusting in the Lord."
"The world tells us to seek success, power and money;
God tells us to seek humility, service and love."
"In this Year of Faith, we pray to the Lord that the Church may always be a true family that brings God’s love to everyone."
The whole of salvation history is the story of God looking for us: he offers us love and welcomes us with tenderness.
"The Church is born from the supreme act of love on the Cross, from Jesus’ open side.  The Church is a family where we love and are loved."
"Dear young people, the Church expects great things of you and your generosity. Don’t be afraid to aim high."
"Every time we give in to selfishness and say “No” to God, we spoil his loving plan for us."
We all have in our hearts some areas of unbelief. Let us say to the Lord: I believe!  Help my unbelief.
"Miracles happen. But prayer is needed! Prayer that is courageous, struggling and persevering, not prayer that is a mere formality."
On the feast of Mary Help of Christians I join the Catholics in China who trust in the protection of Our Lady of Sheshan and I pray for them
Do I take the Gospel message of reconciliation and love into the places where I live and work?
To live according to the Gospel is to fight against selfishness. The Gospel is forgiveness and peace; it is love that comes from God.
"I am close to the families of all who died in the Oklahoma tornado, especially those who lost young children. Join me in praying for them."
"The Holy Spirit transforms and renews us, creates harmony and unity, and gives us courage and joy for mission."
"We must learn from Mary, and we must imitate her unconditional readiness to receive Christ in her life."
Are our lives truly filled with the presence of God?  How many things take the place of God in my life each day?
We cannot be part-time Christians!  We should seek to live our faith at every moment of every day.
"It is God who gives life.  Let us respect and love human life, especially vulnerable life in a mother’s womb."
Am I faithful to Christ in my daily life?  Am I able to “show” my faith with respect but also with courage?
Let us pray for the many Christians in the world who still suffer persecution and violence.  May God grant them the courage of fidelity.
"The Holy Spirit helps us to view others with fresh eyes, seeing them always as brothers and sisters in Jesus, to be respected and loved."
The Holy Spirit brings to our hearts a most precious gift: profound trust in God’s love and mercy.
"I have come that they may have life and have it in abundance, says Jesus.  This is where true wealth is found, not in material things!"
Do not be content to live a mediocre Christian life: walk with determination along the path of holiness.
Let us ask our Lord to help us bear shining witness to his mercy and his love in every area of our Christian lives.
Every Christian is a missionary to the extent that he or she bears witness to God’s love.  Be missionaries of God’s tenderness!
Let us ask Our Lady to teach us how to live out our faith in our daily lives and to make more room for the Lord.
"It would be a good idea, during May, for families to say the Rosary together.  Prayer strengthens family life."
"My thoughts turn to all who are unemployed, often as a result of a self-centred mindset bent on profit at any cost."
"Dear young friends, learn from Saint Joseph. He went through difficult times, but he always trusted, and he knew how to overcome adversity."
"Let us put our trust in God’s power at work!  With him, we can do great things.  He will give us the joy of being his disciples."

"Mary is the one who says “Yes”.  Mary, help us to come to know the voice of Jesus better, and to follow it."
"Each one of us longs for love, for truth, for life – and Jesus is all of these things in abundance!"
“The sheep that belong to me listen to my voice and I know them.” The voice of Jesus is unmistakable!  He guides us along the path of life.
Please join me in praying for the victims of the explosion in Texas and their families.
"To enter into the glory of God demands daily fidelity to his will, even when it requires sacrifice."
"Jesus’ ascension into heaven does not mean his absence, but that he is alive among us in a new way, close to each one of us."
"Worshipping God means learning to be with him, stripping away our hidden idols and placing him at the centre of our lives."
"Let us not forget: if we are to proclaim the Gospel of Jesus, our lives must bear witness to what we preach."
"If we act like children of God, knowing that he loves us, our lives will be made new, filled with serenity and joy."
Being a Christian is not just about following commandments: it is about letting Christ take possession of our lives and transform them.
How beautiful is the gaze with which Jesus regards us – how full of tenderness!  Let us never lose trust in the patience and mercy of God.
"God loves us.  We must not be afraid to love him.  The faith is professed with the lips and with the heart, through words and through love."
"Accept the risen Jesus into your life. Even if you have been far away, take a small step towards him: he awaits you with open arms."
"Support your priests with your love and prayers, that they may always be shepherds after Christ’s heart"
To experience Holy Week is to enter more and more into God's logic of love and self-giving
